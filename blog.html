  Leonardo da Vinci was not merely an artist, nor only a scientist.
  He was a phenomenon — a mind so restless and precise that centuries later,
  humanity still measures genius against his name.
  Living at the heart of the Renaissance, Leonardo refused to see boundaries
  between art and science, believing that true understanding came from observing
  the world in its purest form.
  He studied the movement of water, the structure of the human body,
  the mechanics of flight, and the emotions hidden within a human face.
  Every sketch, painting, and handwritten note reflected an insatiable curiosity
  driven by one question: <em>how does the world truly work?</em>

</figure>

<p>
  Born in Vinci, a small rural town in Tuscany, Leonardo da Vinci came into the world
  on April 15, 1452, during the height of the Italian Renaissance.
  He was the illegitimate son of Ser Piero, a Florentine legal notary,
  and Caterina, a local peasant woman.
  Although this status excluded him from formal classical education,
  it placed Leonardo closer to nature — a setting that would profoundly shape
  his way of thinking.
</p>

<p>
  Raised primarily in the countryside near Anchiano, Leonardo spent his early years
  observing rivers, rocks, plants, animals, and the changing patterns of light.
  These quiet explorations became the foundation of his lifelong belief that
  art, science, and nature were inseparable.
  Rather than memorizing ancient texts, he learned directly from the world itself,
  developing an approach rooted in observation, experimentation, and curiosity.
</p>

<p>
  Records from his baptism, preserved in local archives, mark the beginning of a life
  that would later redefine human creativity.
  By his teenage years, Leonardo’s exceptional talent for drawing and mechanical thinking
  was evident, prompting his family to send him to Florence —
  a decision that would place him at the center of Renaissance innovation
  and begin his formal journey into art and engineering.
</p>

     <!-- PHILOSOPHY & THOUGHT -->

<section class="philosophy">

  <h2>Philosophy & Thought</h2>

  <h3>Observation as the Source of Truth</h3>
  <p>
    Leonardo da Vinci believed that true knowledge begins with observation.
    He rejected blind acceptance of tradition and authority, arguing that
    understanding must arise from direct experience with the natural world.
    To Leonardo, seeing was not passive — it was an active, disciplined act
    requiring patience, accuracy, and humility before nature.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “All our knowledge has its origin in our perceptions.”
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Experience Over Dogma</h3>
  <p>
    Deeply skeptical of inherited beliefs, Leonardo challenged established
    doctrines that could not be tested or observed. He believed that dogma
    limits the human mind, while experience expands it. Knowledge, in his view,
    was not something to be accepted but something to be verified through
    repeated engagement with reality.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Experience never errs; it is only your judgment that errs.”
  </blockquote>

  <h3>The Unity of Knowledge</h3>
  <p>
    Leonardo’s philosophy was grounded in unity. He refused to divide the world
    into isolated disciplines, seeing art, mathematics, nature, and human
    understanding as interconnected expressions of a single underlying order.
    This holistic worldview shaped the way he thought, learned, and created.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Study the science of art. Study the art of science.”
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Curiosity as a Moral Duty</h3>
  <p>
    Curiosity was not merely an interest for Leonardo — it was a responsibility.
    He believed that the human mind is meant to question, explore, and seek
    understanding. Intellectual laziness and unquestioned belief were, to him,
    forms of failure. Curiosity was the engine of wisdom and the path toward
    truth.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding.”
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Human Perception and Illusion</h3>
  <p>
    Leonardo was keenly aware of the limitations of human perception.
    He believed that the senses can deceive, and that wisdom lies in
    recognizing one’s own intellectual biases. Many of his reflections
    warn against arrogance, certainty, and unexamined opinions.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “The greatest deception men suffer is from their own opinions.”
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Thought in Action</h3>
  <p>
    For Leonardo, philosophy was not abstract speculation. Thought had value
    only when it shaped action. Understanding demanded application, and
    reflection demanded practice. This belief defined his relentless habit
    of sketching, writing, and revising ideas throughout his life.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Being willing is not enough; we must do.”
  </blockquote>

  <p class="philosophy-summary">
    Leonardo da Vinci’s philosophy reveals a mind committed to observation,
    unity, curiosity, and intellectual humility. His thoughts form a timeless
    framework for understanding the world — one that values experience over
    authority and inquiry over certainty.
  </p>

      <!-- SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH -->

<section class="scientific-research">

  <h2>Scientific Research</h2>

  <p>
    Leonardo da Vinci’s scientific work was recorded primarily in his notebooks,
    where thousands of pages of drawings and observations reveal a systematic
    study of the natural world. His research was driven by direct observation,
    experimentation, and visual analysis, making his approach remarkably close
    to modern scientific methods — centuries before they were formally defined.
  </p>

  <h3>Anatomy and the Human Body</h3>
  <p>
    Leonardo conducted extensive anatomical research through the dissection of
    human and animal bodies. His drawings of muscles, bones, joints, organs, and
    the circulatory system are among the most accurate of the Renaissance period.
    He was particularly interested in how structure related to movement, emotion,
    and function, using anatomy to better understand both life and artistic form.
  </p>

  <h3>Hydrodynamics and the Study of Water</h3>
  <p>
    Water fascinated Leonardo more than any other natural element.
    He studied the flow of rivers, turbulence, whirlpools, erosion, and flooding,
    treating water as a living force governed by mathematical laws.
    His sketches analyze wave motion and current behavior, anticipating principles
    of fluid dynamics that would not be formally described until centuries later.
  </p>

  <h3>Geology and the History of the Earth</h3>
  <p>
    Leonardo questioned traditional explanations of fossils and rock formations.
    He correctly argued that seashells found in mountains were evidence of ancient
    oceans rather than remnants of biblical floods. His geological observations
    demonstrate a deep understanding of sedimentation, erosion, and the slow
    transformation of Earth over time.
  </p>

  <h3>Optics, Light, and Vision</h3>
  <p>
    Leonardo carried out detailed studies of light, shadow, reflection, and
    perspective. He examined how the human eye perceives depth, color, and form,
    and how light interacts with surfaces. These investigations influenced both
    scientific understanding and artistic techniques, allowing him to achieve
    unprecedented realism in visual representation.
  </p>

  <h3>Flight and Aerodynamics</h3>
  <p>
    Inspired by birds and bats, Leonardo closely studied the mechanics of flight.
    He produced numerous sketches of flying machines, gliders, parachutes, and
    winged devices based on anatomical observation and airflow principles.
    Although these machines were never built in his lifetime, they represent one
    of the earliest serious attempts to understand and replicate human flight.
  </p>

  <h3>Mechanical Engineering and Motion</h3>
  <p>
    Leonardo investigated gears, pulleys, levers, and transmission systems,
    designing machines for construction, warfare, and automation.
    His studies of motion examined friction, force, and balance, revealing a
    mechanical understanding far ahead of contemporary engineering knowledge.
  </p>

  <h3>Scientific Method and Legacy</h3>
  <p>
    Unlike many scholars of his era, Leonardo did not rely solely on ancient texts.
    He emphasized observation, repetition, and visual documentation.
    Though much of his scientific work remained unpublished, his notebooks
    demonstrate an experimental mindset that anticipated the foundations of
    modern science and engineering.
  </p>
